# twitchy-poison

Rewrite of twitchy-streamer (proprietary / GerbilScheme) to Elixir/OTP

## twitchy-streamer

... is a desktop (Twitch.tv) streaming suite and chat-app featuring

* performing livestreams (using ffmpeg) with custom filtes to get the best quality
* designs to encourage going into a flow state
* a TODO app
* Twitch/IRC chat
* custom alerts
* custom twitch commands
* a twitch bot

And it exists to serve _me_ . Feature requests are welcome, but I won't necessarily prioritise feature requests that don't align with my ideas.
